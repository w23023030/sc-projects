This program plays hangman game.
Users sees a dashed word, trying to
correctly figure the un-dashed word out
by inputting one character each round.
If the user input is correct, show the
updated word on console. Players have N_TURNS
to try in order to win this game.

    The program will randomly select an English word (represented by answer) from the font library,
    and cover each letter with a dash. Each time the player enters an uppercase or lowercase letter (represented by
    input_ch), if input_ch exists in answer, the program will update the dashes and display all the positions
    of input_ch. However, if input_ch does not exist in answer, the player will lose a life.
    If seven times have not been guessed, seven lives are gone, and the player challenge fails.
